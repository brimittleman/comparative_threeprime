```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```


This is where I am keeping notes about my snakefile and config files for the human and chimp processing.  

Genome files: 
* /project2/gilad/spott/Pipelines/dropseq_pipeline/STAR_indeces/panTro5_UCSC/panTro5.fa  


* /project2/gilad/spott/Pipelines/dropseq_pipeline/STAR_indeces/hg38_UCSC/hg38_ucsc.fa 


I moved both of these to my genome annotation directroy in comp_genomes. 
When I build the index I need to use a species variable from the config file. I will also need seperate project directories for each species but the additional scripts can point to the same place. 


**Need to add length files to the config files**
